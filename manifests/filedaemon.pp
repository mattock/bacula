#
# == Class: bacula::filedaemon
#
# Setup Bacula Director daemon. The list of backed up machines is generated 
# dynamically from configuration file fragments exported by nodes that include 
# the bacula::filedaemon class. In other words, the filedaemon nodes add 
# themselves to the backup cycle.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*manage*]
#   Manage Bacula Filedaemon using Puppet. Valid values are true (default) and 
#   false.
# [*manage_packetfilter*]
#   Manage packet filtering rules. Valid values are true (default) and false.
# [*manage_monit*]
#   Manage monit rules. Valid values are true (default) and false.
# [*status*]
#   Status of the Bacula Filedaemon. Valid values are 'present' and 'absent'. 
#   Default value is 'present'. This is primary useful when decommissioning 
#   nodes to ensure that exported resources are cleaned up properly.
# [*package_name*]
#   Override the default package name obtained from params.pp. This is useful
#   if your operating system provides two different bacula-fd/bacula-client 
#   versions under different names, e.g. for compatibility reasons. For example 
#   on FreeBSD 10 you need to set this parameter to 'bacula5-client' to be able 
#   to connect to 5.2.x-based Directors and StorageDaemons.
# [*director_address_ipv4*]
#   IP-address for incoming Bacula Director packets.
# [*pwd_for_director*]
#   Password for the Director that contacts this filedaemon
# [*pwd_for_monitor*]
#   Password for the Monitor that contacts this filedaemon
# [*bind_address*]
#   Bind to this IPv4 address. Defaults to '127.0.0.1'. Use '0.0.0.0' to bind to 
#   all interfaces.
# [*tls_enable*]
#   Enable TLS. Valid values are true and false (default).
# [*use_puppet_certs*]
#   Use puppet certs for TLS. Valid values are true (default) and false.
# [*backup_files*]
#   An array containing the list of directories/files to backup
# [*exclude_files*]
#   An array containing a list of directories/files/wildcards to exclude from 
#   backups. Defaults to undef.
# [*schedules*]
#   An array containing "Run" lines for a Filedaemon-specific schedule.
#   Defaults to undef which means that the default Schedule called
#   "default-schedule" defined in the bacula::director class is used.
# [*messages*]
#   Which messages should be sent via email. Use "All" for (almost) all
#   messages and "AllButInformational" for everything except "Backup OK of
#   <node>..." messages and like. Defaults to "All".
# [*monitor_email*]
#   Email address where local service monitoring software sends it's reports to.
#   Defaults to global variable $::servermonitor.
